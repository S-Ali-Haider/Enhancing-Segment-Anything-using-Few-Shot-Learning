# Enhancing-Segment-Anything-using-Few-Shot-Learning
Presenting a novel yet simple system that extends SAMâ€™s segmentation capabilities by automatically picking the correct segmentation mask. The approach leverages the power of few-shot learning (FSL) methods coupled with an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) threshold strategy. 

## About the Repository:<br>
. The Code folder contains a single Python Notebook. <br>

. The Datasets folder contains two zipped datasets needed to execute the Python file provided.<br>

. The repository does not contain the code which was used for creating segmentation masks using the pretrained SAM.<br>
